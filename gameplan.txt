analyze all data
  - create object for char stats
  - create object for each character 
    - store win count (or win %?) for each character
  - Determine average win count (or win %?) for all characters
    - Determine mean win count (or win %?)
    - Determine global Character variance and std deviation
    - Determine population variance btw characters [squared diff btw each win num and mean]
    - Determine standard deviation btw characters [sqrt of variance]
  - Determine Team based stats (per team)
    - Determine population variance [squared diff btw each num and mean]
    - Determine standard deviation [sqrt of variance]
  - In each character object
    - store how many std deviations from the mean for character win count (or win %?)
  ?? variance of winning percentage overall from the sum of the individual game variances.??
  
  X Conditional Probability: champ1 winning% * (1 - champ2 winning %) / (1 - champ2 winning %)
  - Conditional Probability: (champ1 winning% vs champ2) / (1 - champ2 winning %) - if storing individual matchups
  X Conditional Probability of champ1 winning and champ2 losing: champ1 winning% * (1 - champ2 winning % vs champ1) - if storing individual matchups
  X P(at least 1 success) = 1−P(all failures) >>> 1 - (champ2 winning% vs champ1)*(champ3 winning% vs champ1)*(champ4 winning% vs champ1)*(champ5 winning% vs champ1)*(champ6 winning% vs champ1)
  - P(at least 1 success) = 1−P(all failures) >>> 1 - (1 - champ1 winning% vs champ2)*(1 - champ1 winning% vs champ3)*(1 - champ1 winning% vs champ4)*(1 - champ1 winning% vs champ5)*(1 - champ1 winning% vs champ6)
