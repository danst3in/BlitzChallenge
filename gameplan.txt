analyze all data
  - create object for char stats
  - create object for each character 
    - store win count (or win %?) for each character
  - Determine average win count (or win %?) for all characters
    - Determine mean win count (or win %?)
    - Determine global Character variance and std deviation
    - Determine population variance btw characters [squared diff btw each win num and mean]
    - Determine standard deviation btw characters [sqrt of variance]
  - Determine Team based stats (per team)
    - Determine population variance [squared diff btw each num and mean]
    - Determine standard deviation [sqrt of variance]
  - In each character object
    - store how many std deviations from the mean for character win count (or win %?)
  ?? variance of winning percentage overall from the sum of the individual game variances.??
  - Conditional Probability: champ1 winning% * (1 - champ2 winning %) / (1 - champ2 winning %)
  - Conditional Probability: (champ1 winning% vs champ2) / (1 - champ2 winning %) - if storing individual matchups
